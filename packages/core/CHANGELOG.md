# @data-client/core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- bf141cb5a5: Removed deprecated Endpoint.optimisticUpdate -> use Endpoint.getOptimisticResponse
- bf141cb5a5: legacyActions were removed. use action imports directly
  New action types match previously exported newActions and have different form
  This will likely require updating any custom Managers
- bf141cb5a5: Deprecations:
  - controller.receive, controller.receiveError
  - RECEIVE_TYPE
  - MiddlewareAPI.controller (MiddlewareAPI is just controller itself)
    - ({controller}) => {} -> (controller) => {}
- bf141cb5a5: NetworkManager interface changed to only support new actions
  SubscriptionManager/PollingSubscription interfaces simplified based on new actions
- bf141cb5a5: reducer -> createReducer(new Controller())
- 9788090c55: Controller.fetch() returns denormalized form when Endpoint has a Schema
- bf141cb5a5: resetAction requires a date
- bf141cb5a5: state.lastReset must be number
