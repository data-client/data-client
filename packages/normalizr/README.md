## Install

Install from the NPM repository using yarn or npm:

```shell
yarn add @data-client/normalizr
```

```shell
npm install --save @data-client/normalizr
```

## Motivation

Many APIs, public or not, return JSON data that has deeply nested objects. Using data in this kind of structure is often very difficult for JavaScript applications, especially those using [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) or [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

## Solution

Normalizr is a small, but powerful utility for taking JSON with a schema definition and returning nested entities with their IDs, gathered in dictionaries.

## Quick Start

Consider a typical blog post. The API response for a single post might look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "author": {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Paul"
  },
  "title": "My awesome blog post",
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": "324",
      "commenter": {
        "id": "2",
        "name": "Nicole"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

We have two nested entity types within our `article`: `users` and `comments`. Using various `schema`, we can normalize all three entity types down:

```js
import { normalize, schema, Entity } from '@data-client/normalizr';

// Define a users schema
class User extends Entity {
  pk() {
    return this.id;
  }
}

// Define your comments schema
class Comment extends Entity {
  pk() {
    return this.id;
  }

  static schema = {
    commenter: User,
  };
}

// Define your article
class Article extends Entity {
  pk() {
    return this.id;
  }

  static schema = {
    author: User,
    comments: [Comment],
  };
}

const normalizedData = normalize(originalData, Article);
```

Now, `normalizedData` will be:

```js
{
  result: "123",
  entities: {
    "Article": {
      "123": {
        id: "123",
        author: "1",
        title: "My awesome blog post",
        comments: [ "324" ]
      }
    },
    "User": {
      "1": { "id": "1", "name": "Paul" },
      "2": { "id": "2", "name": "Nicole" }
    },
    "Comment": {
      "324": { id: "324", "commenter": "2" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

None.
