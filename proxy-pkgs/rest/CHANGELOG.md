# Change Log

## 7.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 4317adb94c: Collection based pagination now replaces the non-list members on page

  This allows members like nextPage or 'cursor' to be updated when
  each page is fetched making it easier to know which page to fetch next.

- a097d25e7a: controller.fetchIfStale() resolves to data from store if it does not fetch
- Updated dependencies [4317adb94c]
  - @data-client/rest@0.7.1

## 7.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c8c5575e5a: Add 'paginationField' parameter to [RestEndpoint](https://dataclient.io/rest/api/RestEndpoint#paginationfield) and [createResource](https://dataclient.io/rest/api/createResource#paginationfield)

  This adds a '[getPage](https://dataclient.io/rest/api/RestEndpoint#getPage)' member; similar to getList.push/unshift but for [pagination](https://dataclient.io/rest/guides/pagination).

  ```ts
  const TodoResource = createResource({
    path: '/todos/:id',
    schema: Todo,
    paginationField: 'page',
  }).getList.getPage({ page: '2' });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- c8c5575e5a: Fix case where sometimes paginating would not update a collection

  This was due to the comparison not using string serialization (canonical form for collection comparisons)

- c8c5575e5a: Ignore 'undefined' parameters in collection matching
- Updated dependencies [c8c5575e5a]
- Updated dependencies [c8c5575e5a]

### Minor Changes

- af8b76079f: Support FormData in Resource updates and creates

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [af8b76079f]
  - @data-client/rest@0.6.0

## 7.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 51b4b0d188: Deprecate Resource.create
- 51b4b0d188: Add Resource.extend()

  This is polymorphic, and has three forms

  Set any field based on arguments:

  ```ts
  Resource.extend('fieldName', { path: 'mypath/:id' });
  ```

  Override any of the provided endpoints with options:

  ```ts
  Resource.extend({
    getList: {
      path: 'mypath/:id',
    },
    update: {
      body: {} as Other,
    },
  });
  ```

  Function to compute derived endpoints:

  ```ts
  Resource.extend(base => ({
    getByComment: base.getList.extend({
      path: 'repos/:owner/:repo/issues/comments/:comment/reactions',
    }),
  }));
  ```
